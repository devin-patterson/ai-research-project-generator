This methodology combines both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to provide rich, contextual insights into the research question.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Case study design**: The company-specific focus of this research (Cisco) and the need for in-depth exploration of cultural differences justify a case study approach (Yin, 2014). This design allows for an examination of the specific context within which technology teams operate.\n2. **Mixed-methods approach**: Combining qualitative (e.g., interviews, observations) and quantitative (e.g., surveys) methods will enable the collection of both contextual, subjective data and more generalizable, numerical data. This mixed-methods approach can provide a comprehensive understanding of the research question (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).\n3. **Flexibility**: The case study design offers flexibility in terms of research location, sample size, and data collection methods, allowing for adaptation to emerging findings and unexpected challenges.\n\n**Alternative Methodologies:**\n\n1. **Survey-based approach**: A survey can be used as a primary method if the focus is on collecting quantitative data from a larger sample (e.g., employees across multiple teams). However, this might not provide in-depth contextual information.\n2. **Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)**: FGDs could be an alternative to interviews for gathering qualitative data. While they can be useful for exploring group dynamics and opinions, the researcher may struggle to delve into individual perspectives.\n\n**Data Collection Methods:**\n\n1. **In-depth Interviews**: Conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from China-based and US-based technology teams at Cisco (n = 20-30). This will allow for exploration of personal experiences, cultural differences, and team dynamics.\n2. **Surveys**: Design a survey to collect quantitative data on team performance, communication styles, and other relevant variables (n = 100-200).\n3. **Observations**: Conduct observations of team meetings or project work sessions in both locations to gather contextual information.\n\n**Analysis Techniques:**\n\n1. **Thematic Analysis**: Use thematic analysis for qualitative data from interviews, FGDs, and observations.\n2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Apply descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) to quantitative survey data.\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare results between China-based and US-based teams using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).\n\n**Sample Size Considerations:**\n\n1. **Qualitative Sample Size**: 20-30 participants from both locations will provide sufficient depth for in-depth interviews and observations.\n2. **Quantitative Sample Size**: A minimum of 100-200 survey respondents is recommended to ensure generalizability.\n\n**Potential Limitations:**\n\n1. **Selection Bias**: The sample may be biased towards team members with more significant roles or responsibilities, which could influence the results.\n2. **Contextual Dependence**: Results might not generalize across other companies or industries due to the specific context of Cisco.\n\n**Ethical Considerations:**\n\n1. **Informed Consent**: Obtain informed consent from all participants before collecting data.\n2. **Anonymity and Confidentiality**: Ensure participant anonymity and confidentiality throughout the research process.\n3. **Avoiding Harm**: Minimize potential harm by avoiding sensitive or controversial topics, especially in a company-specific context.\n\n**References:**\n\nCreswell, J.

It was developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) to serve an ever-growing need for improved video compression as well as to support a wider variety of today’s media content and emerging applications. This paper provides an overview of the novel technical features for new applications and the core compression technologies for achieving significant bit rate reductions in the neighborhood of 50% over its predecessor for equal video quality, the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, and 75% over the currently most-used format, the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) standard. It is explained how these new features in VVC provide greater versatility for applications. Highlighted applications include video with resolutions beyond standard- and high-definition, video with high dynamic range and wide color gamut, adaptive streaming with resolution changes, computer-generated and screen-captured video, ultralow-delay streaming, 360° immersive video, and multilayer coding e.g., for scalability.

This has created a huge attack surface that requires the deployment of effective and practical countermeasures to protect network infrastructures from the harm that cyber-attacks can cause. Hence, there is an absolute need to differentiate boundaries in personal information and cloud and fog computing globally and the adoption of specific information security policies and regulations. The goal of the security policy and framework for cloud and fog computing is to protect the end-users and their information, reduce task-based operations, aid in compliance, and create standards for expected user actions, all of which are based on the use of established rules for cloud computing. Moreover, intrusion detection systems are widely adopted solutions to monitor and analyze network traffic and detect anomalies that can help identify ongoing adversarial activities, trigger alerts, and automatically block traffic from hostile sources. This survey paper analyzes factors, including the application of technologies and techniques, which can enable the deployment of security policy on fog and cloud computing successfully. The paper focuses on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and intrusion detection, which provides an effective and resilient system structure for users and organizations. Our survey aims to provide a framework for a cloud and fog computing security policy, while addressing the required security tools, policies, and services, particularly for cloud and fog environments for organizational adoption. While developing the essential linkage between requirements, legal aspects, analyzing techniques and systems to reduce intrusion detection, we recommend the strategies for cloud and fog computing security policies. The paper develops structured guidelines for ways in which organizations can adopt and audit the security of their systems as security is an essential component of their systems and presents an agile current state-of-the-art review of intrusion detection systems and their principles. Functionalities and techniques for developing these defense mechanisms are considered, along with concrete products utilized in operational systems.

Here, we focus on gender to provide a comprehensive analysis of group-based biases in widely-used static English word embeddings trained on internet corpora (GloVe 2014, fastText 2017). Using the Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence of gender biases that also show differences in: (1) frequencies of words associated with men versus women; (b) part-of-speech tags in gender-associated words; (c) semantic categories in gender-associated words; and (d) valence, arousal, and dominance in gender-associated words. First, in terms of word frequency: we find that, of the 1,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary, 77% are more associated with men than women, providing direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of the English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top male-associated words are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the top female-associated words are typically adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving, emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate parts-of-speech. Third, for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000 words associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and domains of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast, the top female-associated concepts are less focused on roles, including, instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content, as well as appearance and kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and dominance from a ~20,000 word lexicon, we find that male-associated words are higher on arousal and dominance, while female-associated words are higher on valence.","year":2022,"doi":"10.1145/3514094.3534162","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534162","citation_count":61,"venue":null,"source":"openalex","pdf_url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3514094.3534162"},{"title":"Individual vs. Team Sport Failure—Similarities, Differences, and Current Developments","authors":["V.

Although a number of theories about the reasons for the occurrence of choking under pressure exist and several intervention approaches have been developed, underlying mechanisms of choking are still under debate and the effectiveness of existing interventions remains contested. These sudden performance declines also occur in team sport. “Collective sport team collapse,” which describes the situation when an entire sport team underperforms significantly within an important competitive situation, has received less empirical attention, in comparison to individual choking research. While there are a few studies that have investigated causes of collective team collapse, understandably, there has been limited empirical investigation of preventative and intervention strategies. Although the two constructs appear to share several similar characteristics and mechanisms, research has not yet examined the conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and practical links between choking under pressure and collective sport team collapse. In this review article, we seek to examine these similarities and differences and identify new ways of thinking about future interventions. Furthermore, current empirical understandings in the field of choking under pressure and collective sport team collapse are presented and the most effective intervention approaches for both constructs are introduced.

Most research has focused on depolarisation interventions (interventions designed to reduce affective polarisation) amongst American political groups. Evidence suggests that classic interventions - such as imagined contact, are less effective at reducing negative feelings towards out-group members for political groups relative to non-partisan groups. This is because political groups are more morally charged than non-partisan groups. Research suggests that partisans view co-partisans as more morally superior to out-partisans. Until now however, the role this belief of in-group moral superiority in driving affective polarisation, had not been tested directly. In this study, a novel task was used to investigate the role of perceived intergroup differences in morality in driving affective polarisation amongst groups divided by Brexit opinions in the UK. This novel task had participants make predictions of the moral behaviour of in-group and out-group members. The feedback participants were given on their moral predictions was manipulated such that participants were either told information that was confirmatory of in-group moral superiority or violated expectations of in-group moral superiority. Results showed that the tendency to view co-partisans as generally more morally superior to out-partisans, predicted increased levels of partisan animosity but not increased intentions to hurt out-partisans’ chances of winning a monetary reward. Results further showed that partisan animosity but not out-group harm, was indeed greater when participants were given feedback that were confirmatory of in-group moral superiority relative to when participants were given feedback that violated a perception of in-group moral superiority. This finding suggests that a belief that co-partisans are morally superior to out-partisans, in part, drives affective polarisation. Hence the designing of depolarisation interventions that reduce a perception of in-group moral superiority may be efficacious, and thus merits future research.</p>","year":null,"doi":"10.31219/osf.io/excz4","url":"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/excz4","citation_count":1,"venue":null,"source":"crossref","pdf_url":null},{"title":"Athletes’ basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation: differences between individual vs. team sports","authors":["Nico W.

The present research aimed to extend current understanding of how sport modality (individual vs. team) relates to these sources of autonomous motivation in athletes.

In contrast, team sport athletes reported higher relatedness satisfaction and, in Study 2 only, higher competence satisfaction. As anticipated, differences emerged in the sources of autonomous motivation rather than in the overall strength of autonomous motivation itself.

A total of 810 people took part in the study, representing organisations in the public and private sectors with different organisational roles. Participants answered questions on the scale on individualism and collectivism of equality and hierarchy (KIRH), constructed based on Singelis and Triandis' (1995) concept. The survey was conducted in May 2023 in Polish private and public organisations. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the level of hierarchical and equalitarian individualism and collectivism according to organisation type and organisational role in the research design of organisation type (public vs. private) x organisational role (managerial vs. employee).\nThe research shows that the level of equality collectivism varies according to organisational role. It is higher among managers than among team members. The level of hierarchical collectivism varies according to the type of organisation and role. It is higher among team leaders in public organisations. \nNo significant differences were found in the level of equality and hierarchical individualism between public and private organisations, as well as between managers and team members. The study confirms the existence of cultural differences between the public and private sectors and between managers and team members.

However, inconsistent accounting policies between China and the US have resulted in the delisting of certain China Concepts Stocks (CCS) in the US. Nonetheless, the recent accounting review cooperation agreement between the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the US PCAOB has altered the future prospects of CCS in the US. This study aims to quantify the economic value of this bilateral collaboration using the Audit Supervision Cooperation Agreement, signed by China and the US on August 26, 2022, as a natural experiment. Our findings reveal that in the three months following the agreement, CCS with political connections and accounting issues related to the Chinese government exhibited returns of 4.63% and 1.13% respectively. We conducted robustness tests including parallel trend tests, experimental and control groups based on VIE architecture interference, and sub analysis samples and placebo tests. Additionally, trading volume and price volatility of politically affiliated companies also experienced positive effects.

This methodology combines both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to provide rich, contextual insights into the research question.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Case study design**: The company-specific focus of this research (Cisco) and the need for in-depth exploration of cultural differences justify a case study approach (Yin, 2014). This design allows for an examination of the specific context within which technology teams operate.\n2. **Mixed-methods approach**: Combining qualitative (e.g., interviews, observations) and quantitative (e.g., surveys) methods will enable the collection of both contextual, subjective data and more generalizable, numerical data. This mixed-methods approach can provide a comprehensive understanding of the research question (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).\n3. **Flexibility**: The case study design offers flexibility in terms of research location, sample size, and data collection methods, allowing for adaptation to emerging findings and unexpected challenges.\n\n**Alternative Methodologies:**\n\n1. **Survey-based approach**: A survey can be used as a primary method if the focus is on collecting quantitative data from a larger sample (e.g., employees across multiple teams). However, this might not provide in-depth contextual information.\n2. **Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)**: FGDs could be an alternative to interviews for gathering qualitative data. While they can be useful for exploring group dynamics and opinions, the researcher may struggle to delve into individual perspectives.\n\n**Data Collection Methods:**\n\n1. **In-depth Interviews**: Conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from China-based and US-based technology teams at Cisco (n = 20-30). This will allow for exploration of personal experiences, cultural differences, and team dynamics.\n2. **Surveys**: Design a survey to collect quantitative data on team performance, communication styles, and other relevant variables (n = 100-200).\n3. **Observations**: Conduct observations of team meetings or project work sessions in both locations to gather contextual information.\n\n**Analysis Techniques:**\n\n1. **Thematic Analysis**: Use thematic analysis for qualitative data from interviews, FGDs, and observations.\n2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Apply descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) to quantitative survey data.\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare results between China-based and US-based teams using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).\n\n**Sample Size Considerations:**\n\n1. **Qualitative Sample Size**: 20-30 participants from both locations will provide sufficient depth for in-depth interviews and observations.\n2. **Quantitative Sample Size**: A minimum of 100-200 survey respondents is recommended to ensure generalizability.\n\n**Potential Limitations:**\n\n1. **Selection Bias**: The sample may be biased towards team members with more significant roles or responsibilities, which could influence the results.\n2. **Contextual Dependence**: Results might not generalize across other companies or industries due to the specific context of Cisco.\n\n**Ethical Considerations:**\n\n1. **Informed Consent**: Obtain informed consent from all participants before collecting data.\n2. **Anonymity and Confidentiality**: Ensure participant anonymity and confidentiality throughout the research process.\n3. **Avoiding Harm**: Minimize potential harm by avoiding sensitive or controversial topics, especially in a company-specific context.\n\n**References:**\n\nCreswell, J.
